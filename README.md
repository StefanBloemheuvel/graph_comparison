## Data
data can be found at = https://zenodo.org/record/7900964

## Requirements
* tensorflow
* tsl
* numpy
* pandas
* cuda
* networkx
  
## Usage
the inputs_la, input_bay, inputs_ci and inputs_cw files should be put in the sensor locations folder.
in a 'data' folder the whole data.zip file should be placed.
run either the earthquake.py file or traffic.py file for the results.
models for the forecasting traffic analysis can be found in all_models.py
